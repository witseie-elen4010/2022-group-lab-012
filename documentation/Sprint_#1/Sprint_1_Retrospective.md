## Sprint Completion Date (Expected)

## Days (actual sprint duration)

## Goal for this sprint
By the end of this sprint, the minimum viable SpaceWordle product must be achieved by completing the following stories:
 - Create a vaild username and password to sign-up (story point 5)
 - Choose singl-player mode to play in (story point 2)
 - Read "How to play" Instructions, rules and examples (story point 2)
 - Choose timed or untimed mode (story point 2)
 - See how long it took to play the game (story point 5)
 - See the playing grid and keyboard displayed on my screen (story point 3)
 - Start making word guesses and recieve feedback based on colour coding (story point 5)
 - Share my color coded-game grid without exposing my word guesses (story point 3)
 - See correct word after six attempts (story point 2)
 Which is a total of 9 stories for this sprint. 7 of these were completed and 2 not completed, a 77.78% completion rate. The product is accessed on http://spacewordle.azurewebsites.net/

In addition, all necessary tests should be implemented and test execution and deployment should be automated at the end of this sprint

## Sprint inspection

### How the sprint went with regards  to individuals and interactions
- The team had physical meetings and remote meetings and all group members attended

### How the sprint went with regards to processes and tools 
- All implemented codes were shared on github 
- There were merge conflicts when collaborating on git which were resolved

### Assumptions that led the team astray and their origins
- Assuming that meetings would take 4 hours. Collaboration meetings took longer because of the routing implementations. 

### What went well during the Sprint
 - Team communicated regularly through the week and held several physical   meetings for better collaboration
 - Most of the user stories were completed and a basic game structure was implemented and working correctly.

### Problems encountered
 - The sprint ended later than was scheduled, it was assumed the team was completely ready to operate in agile development which was not the case 
 - Knowledge on routing and how to implement it correctly was inefficient and sprint was delayed in learning how to route.
 - TBD was not followed correctly and a few commits were made incorrectly 
 - The final web deployment does not produce the desired product content (as is seen when following the above link) 
  - Test execution and deployment were not implemented

### Resolutions to problems and future improvements
 - Improvements are required in the area of following trunk based development and continuous integration. The entire team needs to be acquinted with correctly integrating code.
 - Further understanding of routing and oher back-end development aspects
 

## Sprint Velocity

Using the Fibonacci sequence method, the stories were assigned points between 2 and 5, and the total story points were 29. The sprint velocity is then 29_points/1_sprint = 29
