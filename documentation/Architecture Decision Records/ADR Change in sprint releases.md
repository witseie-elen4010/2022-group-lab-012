# RE-SCHEDULING OF SPRINT RELEASES

Date: 2022-05-24

## Status

Accepted 

## Context

Sprint releases require consistent durations and sprint 1 ended at a later time than scheduled, affecting subsequent sprints. The sprint ended later than expected because of delays in poorly implemented trunk based implementation and routing. 

## Decision

The following sprints will follow week-long duration following this sprints' completion which was on Tuesday 24/05/2022. The sprints 2 and 3 will also be released each Tuesday being 31/05/2022 and 7/06/2022 respectively.


## Consequences

The project sprints are ending later than initially planned as the sprint release dates have been adjusted, which might affect the time available for other project concluding activities such as documentation and demonstration.
